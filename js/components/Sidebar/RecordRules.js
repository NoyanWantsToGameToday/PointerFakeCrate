        <h3>Record Submission Requirements</h3>
        <div class="right-text">
            <p>
                You must have achieved the record without using hacks (including hacks that change the physics of the game, ie. physics bypass via MegaHack. Note that Click Between Frames is allowed but its Physics Bypass setting is banned.).
            </p>
            <p>
                You must have achieved the record on the level that is listed on the site or on an approved bugfixed copy - please check the level ID before you submit a record!
            </p>
            <p>
                The recording must have a previous attempt and death animation shown before the completion, unless the completion is on the first attempt.
            </p>
            <p>
                The recording must show the player hit the end-wall as well as the end screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do not use secret routes, skips, or bug routes!
            </p>
            <p>
                Cheat Indicator is required for all completions via MegaHack, Eclipse, or iCreate Pro. If you do not have Cheat Indicator on, your record will likely be invalidated (this is not 100% required for mobile as of yet due to mobile limitations).
            </p>
            <p>
                Records submitted through DMs will not be accepted. Video proof is required.
            </p>
